"# Minesweeper-JS"

Starting this project at March 29, 2024 10 pm. I am going to try to make this project without chatgpt. Let see how this goes.

Just reached 1:45, I gave up and used chatgpt to create the grid. Finally, I created a grid in javascript. This took no time at all.

Currently 4:40 am. I basically have been working for 2 hours. I played 45 minutes of fortnite.I am going to sleep now.


It is March 30 5 pm, I just came back from De Anza college Tour. I am going to continue with this project.

It is 11pm, throughout the last few hours, I have been dozing between youtube and this project. I am proud to say that I am almost done. I just need to create the bomb count around you, flag, and make GUI alot better.

By the way, all of the commented functions are failed versions of what I was trying to achieve.
