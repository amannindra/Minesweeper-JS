"# Minesweeper-JS" 

Starting this project at March 29, 2024 10 pm. I am going to try to make this project without chatgpt. Let see how this goes.

Just reached 1:45, I gave up and used chatgpt to create the grid. Finally, I created a grid in javascript. This took no time at all.

Currently 4:40 am. I basically have been working for 2 hours. I played 45 minutes of fortnite.I am going to sleep now.
